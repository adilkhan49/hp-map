This is an opportunity to come together as a community, listen about issues in our community and how they affect you and discuss what we can do TOGETHER!
In a country that is increasingly divided with a political system that is often excluding, let's work on doing better together. This assembly for South Norwood is a common sense, better way to make decision together and govern ourselves. It is a totally independent way for local people to gather, listen to each other and make plans for how to work towards improving the things that matter most in our community.

For this gathering on 17th March, we will be exploring youth issues. However, to make a change that sticks we need everyone - young, old, families - to be involved. 
From 5pm a hot meal will be provided for anyone who would like to stay and continue the conversation. There will also be childcare provided for those who need it.

The South Norwood Community Conversation is hosted by the South Norwood Community Kitchen. https://www.southnorwoodcommunitykitchen.co.uk/ ",https://actionnetwork.org/events/south-norwood-community-conversation
